# What is IdeaHub? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
IdeaHub is more of a "I can help" kind of platform. A user may have an idea, but does not have people or how to go about bringing the idea to life. IdeaHub eases the difficulty. Other users could show interest in collaborating in the project (through code or no-code).
IdeaHub provides the platform for discussions and collaboration.
